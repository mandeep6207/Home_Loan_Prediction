### 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Acquired a dataset containing personal and financial details.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized income, loan amount, and correlations.  
4. **Model Building** – Implemented classification models:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. **Prediction** – The trained model predicts if the applicant is **eligible (Y)** or **not eligible (N)** for a home loan.
